<p>The Democrats are projected to win <strong>between 47 and 57</strong> seats in the Senate. The Republicans are projected to win <strong>between 42 and 52</strong> seats in the Senate. In 25000 simulations of the Senate elections from the perspective of July 13, 2020, the Democrats win a majority in <strong>74%</strong> and the Republicans win a majority in <strong>26%</strong>. (Assuming the two independent senators, neither of whom is up for re-election, continue to caucus with the Democrats).</p>
